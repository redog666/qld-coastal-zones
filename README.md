# qld-coastal-zones
Australian hydographic charts do not show Marine National Parks (Green), Habitat Protection (Blue), Conservation (Yellow), Scientific Reserch (Orange) or Preservation (Pink) zones.
The aim of this project is to make available .gpx files that are usable as a layer in OpenCPN, available here https://opencpn.org/ , with the use of the ODraw plugin. https://opencpn.org/OpenCPN/plugins/draw.html
Draw allows layers to be projected over charts and can be turned on/off with 1 click of a mouse.

The target areas are the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP), Great Sandy Marine Park (GSMP) and Moreton Bay Marine Park (MBMP).
