Australian hydographic charts do not show Marine National Parks (Green), Habitat Protection (Blue), Conservation (Yellow), Scientific Reserch (Orange) or Preservation (Pink) zones.
The aim of this project is to make available .gpx files that are usable as a layer in https://opencpn.org/ with the use of the ODraw plugin.

The target areas are the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP), Great Sandy Marine Park (GSMP) and Moreton Bay Marine Park (MBMP).
